I'm good at building robust software for the web and like to build it with a user-centered and pragmatic mindset.

Currently I'm working as a front-end developer for [Mooore Digital](https://www.mooore.nl/) in The Netherlands. I'm experienced in working with headless technology stacks and improving web performance.

## Experience in JavaScript, testing, and many other things

I'm experienced in working with JavaScript-based technologies like NuxtJS and NextJS. I also extremely believe in using a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) architectural pattern to build robust websites and applications.

To make applications even more robust, I've also used many testing libraries like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
