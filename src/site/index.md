Hi, I'm Kris, a front-end developer who's passionate about improving web performance, JAMstack and design systems.

Right now I'm working on my graduation project at [OrangeTalent](https://www.orangetalent.nl/). Researching how we can improve the performance of websites in general and how we can stop developers having to re-invent the wheel while working on the front-end.

I'm good at building things for the web. Love to keep things simple.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/kriskuiper) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-kuiper-0b6897a2/).
