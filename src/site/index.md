Hi, I'm Kris, a front-end developer who's passionate about improving web performance, JAMstack and design systems.

Currently I'm working as a Junior Front-end Developer @ [LOAVIES](https://www.loavies.com/nl/) in The Netherlands.

I'm good at building things for the web. Love to keep things simple.
