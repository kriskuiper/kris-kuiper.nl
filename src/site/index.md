Hi, I'm Kris, a front-end developer who focuses on JAMstack, design systems and performance optimalization.

Right now I'm working on my graduation project at [OrangeTalent](https://www.orangetalent.nl/), helping devs in the process.

I'm good at building things for the web. Love to keep things simple.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/kriskuiper) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-kuiper-0b6897a2/).
